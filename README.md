# Calculating the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)

The Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) can be used within flood risk analysis as described by [Pourali et al (2016)](https://idp.springer.com/authorize/casa?redirect_uri=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12061-014-9130-2.pdf&casa_token=556pHuCiUZQAAAAA:WO37dPPHnd7NObyhuElNhxtywKsM0oq7Z9WX6odYtXlU_oGh7VyPl4_blLJZXa4u8ztt05CSVIkqj_O_ku0). 

#### Within this group assignment you should to the following exercises: 

##### 1. Answer the following questions:
  1. What is the Topographic Wetness Index? 
  2. What input data and parameters are required?
  3. How are the TWI values related to the flood probability?
  
##### 2. Search for FOSS GIS tools to calculate the TWI. 
Search within the QGIS Processing Toolbox, but also for other FOSS projects (also R or Python based) on github for example.


##### 3. Implement the calculation of the TWI as an automatized workflow using the QGIS Model Builder. 
A raster file containing a digital elevation model (DEM) can be downloaded from [here](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/f/d0392835aa3b43a7a676/). For a short tutorial on the Model Builder watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZb5VLTc9-o&t=449s).
